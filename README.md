Web developers have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that their products are inclusive and accessible to everyone. Forms are one of the most common and important elements of web applications, as they allow users to interact with the system, provide feedback, submit data, and perform various tasks. However, forms can also pose many challenges and barriers for users with disabilities, and if not designed and coded properly, they can prevent users from accessing the information and services they need.</p><p>
In this course, software engineer Ifeoma Nwosu shows you how to create accessible forms that follow the best practices and standards of web accessibility. Learn how to improve form accessibility with form controls. Discover ways to help users input data into forms, including various input types like checkboxes, radio buttons, and text. Finally learn how to manage data entry errors and how to help users avoid putting the wrong data into form fields.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
